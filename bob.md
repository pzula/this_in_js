#Why is that happening?

JavaScript has the methods `bind(newThis);` and `apply(newThis, args..);`, which jQuery uses to reset `this`. It's important to keep this in mind when making assumptions about the value of `this` because anything can change it!

# How do we fix `this`?

!SLIDE

# assign `this` to a variable* 
*to save its state

![Define self](/images/define_self.png)

Now, `self` will refer to the Bob object and return the input field

# And all is well with the world

# Another wayâ€¦

!SLIDE

# Pokemasters use $.proxy();

`$.proxy();` can take two parameters: `function` and `context`.

It will take in the function you specify, and return a new one with the context that you specify.

# Using $.proxy(); with Bob

Now `this` is within the context of our Bob object
