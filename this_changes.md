# with the right invocation

!SLIDE

# Case 1: As an object method

When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` is set to the object that the method is called on:

![Pokemon Object](/images/this_case_1.png)


!SLIDE

In this case, when `Pikachu.toString();` is invoked, `this` gets bound to the `Pikachu` object, as we can see in by running `console.log()` on it:

```
console.log(Pikachu.toString()); 
// logs:
// Type is electric
// Ability is static
```

!SLIDE 

# Case 2: Inside of a function

```
function openPokeball() {
	return this;
}

```

Here `function openPokeball() === window;`
and `this` refers to the global object

!SLIDE

# Case 3: Inside of a function* 
*(in strict mode)

```
function openPokeball() {
	"use strict";
	return this;
}
```

Here `function openPokeball() === undefined`
and `this` is not yet set
